# Day 1

- Graphs
  - Nodes are connected by edges
  - Edges may have numeric weights associated with them
    - if not shown, assume all weights are 1
  - Edges may be directed or undirected
    - directed --> it's a one-way edge
    - if there are only undirected edges
      - undirected graph
    - else
      - directed graph
  - Cyclic graphs
    - graphs that can contain a cycle
    - cycle
      - can get to the start node
  - Acyclic graphs
    - graphs that don't contain a cycle
- Represent Graph in memory
  - adjacency matrix
    - grid with true/false or edge weight values showing which nodes are adjacent
  - adjacency list
    - list of all nodes with their adjacent nodes
      - use python dictionary to keep track
